18. Write a C program to demonstrate the working of the keyword long. 

Expected Output :

 The size of int = 4 bytes                                                           
 The size of long = 8 bytes                                                          
 The size of long long = 8 bytes                                                     
 The size of double = 8 bytes                                                        
 The size of long double = 16 byte
