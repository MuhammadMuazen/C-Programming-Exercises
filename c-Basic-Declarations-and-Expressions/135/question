135. Write a C program that reads an integer n and finds the number of combinations of a, b, c and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 9) where (a + b + c + d) will be equal to n.
Input:
n (1 <= n <= 50)

Sample Output:

Input a number:
5

a + b + c + d = n
0, 0, 0, 5
0, 0, 1, 4
....
4, 0, 1, 0
4, 1, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 0

Total number of combinations:
56
