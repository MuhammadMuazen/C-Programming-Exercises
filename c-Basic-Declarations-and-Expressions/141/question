141. Write a C program that reads n digits (given) chosen from 0 to 9 and prints the number of combinations where the sum of the digits equals another given number (s). Do not use the same digits in a combination.
For example, the combinations where n = 3 and s = 6 are as follows:
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
0 + 1 + 5 = 6
0 + 2 + 4 = 6

Sample Output:

Input the number:
3

Sum of the digits:
6
Number of combinations: 3
