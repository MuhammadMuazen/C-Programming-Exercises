91. Write a C program to find the angle between (12:00 to 11:59) the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock. The hour hand and the minute hand are always between 0 and 180 degrees.
For example, when it's 12 o'clock, the angle of the two hands is 0 while 3:00 is 45 degrees and 6:00 is 180 degrees.
Sample Output:

Input hour(h) and minute(m) (separated by a space):
3 0
At 3:00 the angle is 90.0 degrees.
Input hour(h) and minute(m) (separated by a space):
6 15
The angle is 90.0 degrees at 6:15.
Input hour(h) and minute(m) (separated by a space):
12 0
At 12:00 the angle is 0.0 degrees.
