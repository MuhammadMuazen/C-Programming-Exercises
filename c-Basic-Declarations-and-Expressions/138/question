138.Write a C program to test whether two lines are parallel or not. The four points are P(x1, y1), Q(x2, y2), R(x3, y3) and S(x4, y4), check PQ and RS are parallel are not.
Input:
âˆ’100 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 100
Each value is a real number with at most 5 digits after the decimal point.

Sample Output:

Input P(x1,y1):
5
7

Input Q(x2,y2):
3
6

Input R(x3,y3):
8
9

Input S(x4,y4):
5
6

PQ and RS are not parallel!
