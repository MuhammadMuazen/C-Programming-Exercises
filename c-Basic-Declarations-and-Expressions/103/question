103. Write a C program that takes two integers and tests whether they are multiplied or not.
In science, a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer. In other words, for the quantities a and b, we say that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n, which is called the multiplier. If a is not zero, this is equivalent to saying that b/a is an integer.
Sample Output:

Input two integers:
3
9
