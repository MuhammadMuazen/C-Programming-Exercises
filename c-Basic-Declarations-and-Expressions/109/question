109. Write a C program to find and print the square of each even and odd value between 1 and a given number (4 < n < 101).
Sample Output:

Input a number(integer): 15

Square of each even between 1 and 15:
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
6^2 = 36
8^2 = 64
10^2 = 100
12^2 = 144
14^2 = 196

Square of each odd between 1 and 15:
1^2 = 1
3^2 = 9
5^2 = 25
7^2 = 49
9^2 = 81
11^2 = 121
13^2 = 169
