37. Write a C program to read the coordinates (x, y) (in the Cartesian system) and find the quadrant to which it belongs (Quadrant -I, Quadrant -II, Quadrant -III, Quadrant -IV).
Note: A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.
These are often numbered from 1st to 4th and denoted by Roman numerals: I (where the signs of the (x,y) coordinates are I(+,+), II (−,+), III (−,−), and IV (+,−).
Test Data :
Input the Coordinate(x,y):
x: 25
y: 15
Expected Output:
Quadrant-I(+,+)
