5. Write a C program that checks if a positive integer is divisible by either 3 or 7, or both. If the integer is a multiple of 3, then the program will return true. Similarly, if the integer is a multiple of 7, then also the program will return true. If the integer is not a multiple of 3 or 7, then the program will return false.
