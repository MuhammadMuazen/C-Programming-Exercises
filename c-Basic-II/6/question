6. Write a C program that accepts a sequence of positive integers from the user and finds the longest continuous subsequence.

Sample Date:

Length of the sequence: 5
Sequence: 5 2 3 4 1
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 3 [2 3 4]
Length of the sequence: 6
Sequence: 10 20 30 40 50 60
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 6 [10 20 30 40 50 60]
Length of the sequence: 3
Sequence: 5 1 3
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 2 [1 3]
